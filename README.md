#  LockMenu: An App Menu with Lock Screen for Enhanced Security

LockMenu is a JavaScript-based app menu with a lock screen that provides enhanced security for web applications. This feature allows users to protect their sensitive information by requiring a password or other authentication method before accessing the app menu.

The LockMenu element is designed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The menu section displays app icons and relevant information, while the lock screen covers the menu section and prompts users to enter their authentication information.

To use LockMenu, users must first authenticate themselves by entering the correct password or other authentication method. Once authenticated, they can access the app menu and launch their desired applications. LockMenu provides an additional layer of security for web applications, especially those that handle sensitive information. It is customizable and can be easily integrated into any JavaScript-based website.
